== Overview

Setting up a Tower cluster for development with babylon

This assumes using the agnosticd config link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/tree/development/ansible/configs/ans-tower-lab[ans-tower-labs]. 

. Install tower, at this writing 2019-06-24, just a default 3 node cluster
. Create an instance group `dev` of 1 node e.g. tower1
** This will simplify debugging and `venv` setup initially as all work can be assigned to `dev` i.e.tower1
